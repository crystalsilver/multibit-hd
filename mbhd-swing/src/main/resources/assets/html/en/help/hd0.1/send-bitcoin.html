<h4>General procedure</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the destination address (e.g <a href="digibyte:1AhN6rPdrMuKBGFDKR1k9A8SCLYaNgXhty?amount=0.005&label=Please%20donate%20to%20multibit.org">1AhN6rPdrMuKBGFDKR1k9A8SCLYaNgXhty</a> for MultiBit donations)</li>
  <li>Enter a value (e.g. 5mB or 0.005 BTC) in the BTC box.  Make sure you know which <a href="units.html">units</a> you are using. 
  <li>You can enter an amount denominated in <a href="units.html">whatever digibyte unit you have chosen</a> in the left entry field or the amount in your <a href="exchange-settings.html">chosen fiat currency</a> in the right entry field. MultiBit will perform a currency conversion using your <a href="exchange-settings.html">choice of exchange</a>.</li>
  <li>The amount that is sent will always be the amount of digibyte in the BTC box.  If you want to send this amount of digibyte, select "Next".  MultiBit will then show a confirmation screen requiring you to enter your wallet password and giving you the chance to back out. If you proceed then your transaction will be submitted to the Bitcoin network and should be considered irreversible.</li>
  <li>If you do want to proceed then:
  <ol>
    <li>Enter a label (e.g. "My donation to MultiBit") to help you keep track of who you're spending your digibyte on.</li>
    <li>Enter your wallet password, and select "Send".</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Details</h4>
<p>The Bitcoin network requires you to specify the destination address. Any of the following will work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Type in the destination address directly.</li>
  <li>Copy the destination address to the system clipboard and then click on the Paste button next to the address field to paste it in.</li>
  <li>Select a previously used destination address from the list shown at the bottom of the panel.</li>
</ul>

<p>You always get a confirmation screen before your digibyte are actually sent. Click on the  "Next" button to see this confirmation screen. Then:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Check the details on the confirmation screen to make sure the address and amount are correct.</p></li>
  <li><p>Press the Send  button to actually send the digibyte.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When the digibyte are sent, you get a message at the bottom of the confirmation screen. Also, the number of peers (other computers on the Bitcoin
  network) that you are connected to that have seen the transaction is shown. If there is a problem in sending your digibyte an error
  message will be shown instead.</p>
