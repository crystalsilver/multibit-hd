<h3>Restoring a wallet</h3>

<p>If your computer is lost, stolen or damaged, or you accidentally delete your DigiBit HD information, then you will need to restore a wallet.</p>

<h4>Step 1 - Locate your seed phrase</h4>

<p><strong>To restore your wallet and recover your digibyte, you must have your seed phrase.</strong></p>
<p>With your seed phrase, you can recover your digibyte.  You must keep your seed phrase safe, because <strong>anyone</strong> who knows your seed phrase can steal your digibyte.</p>

<h4>Step 2 - Locate your wallet backup folder</h4>

<p>A wallet backup is an encrypted copy of your Bitcoin wallet.   <strong>Provided you know your seed phrase</strong> you can use a wallet backup to recover, in addition to your digibyte:</p>
<ul>
  <li>your contacts and notes,</li>
  <li>your payment history and notes,</li>
  <li>the currencies and exchange rates used in payments.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you followed the instructions in the <a href="getting-started.html">getting started</a> guide then you created  a cloud backup service that continuously uploaded your encrypted wallet files to a server somewhere in the cloud.  Locate the folder on your computer that is now a copy of your cloud backup folder.</p>

<p>If you don't have a backup but you do have your seed phrase then you will be able to recover your digibyte and any transactions present on the block chain. However, without a wallet backup, you will not be able to restore all the extra information such as contacts, notes, payment history, currencies and exchange rates.</p>

<h4>Step 3 - Start the restore process</h4>

<p>From the unlock screen click the "Restore" button and follow the instructions on the DigiBit HD screen.</p>

<h4>If I lost my seed phrase, why couldn't I recover my digibyte with just a backup?</h4>

Because if you could, anyone could.  If your cloud-based backup leaked out of the cloud and onto a thief's computer, the thief could steal all your digibyte.
