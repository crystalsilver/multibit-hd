<h3>Fees</h3>

<p>There are several points where you will likely encounter fees in the Bitcoin network.</p>

<h4>Bitcoin transaction fees (miner's fees)</h4>

<p>It is free to receive digibyte but sending usually incurs a fee to ensure timely inclusion of the transaction into the block chain. This is
  because Bitcoin relies on people all over the world storing the ever-increasing block chain which consumes valuable resources such as
  network bandwidth and disk storage space. The Bitcoin network is also limited on the number of transactions it can place into a block and as
  such miners tend to prioritise transactions based on their profitability.</p>

<p>If a transaction provides a fee to the miners then it is very likely to be included in the next block, if not then it may take several hours
  for a miner to add it. Since most people want their transactions to go through quickly it is common to add a small fee of about 10,000 satoshis.</p>

<p>Transaction fees are calculated based on the size of transaction in bytes in terms of storage rather than the value. The
  rules are a little complicated, but DigiBit HD will work out the appropriate minimum value to ensure timely inclusion of your transaction into
  the next block where possible.</p>

<p>If you regularly receive lots of very small amounts of digibyte then you will likely incur larger fees since it will take the inclusion of many
  small inputs to create a sufficiently large output and these take up storage space. If possible you should try to avoid "dust" amounts which tend
  to be under $1 in value.

<h4>Client fees</h4>

<p>It costs a lot of time, money and effort to create and maintain quality software and DigiBit HD is no exception. In order to ensure that we can continue to
  provide you with software that is up to date with the latest innovations in the Bitcoin ecosystem we charge a fixed 1,000 satoshi fee on each
  transaction. Typically this equates to about $0.005 (half a cent) per transaction.</p>

<p>This fee will adjust in line with the Bitcoin transaction fees through ongoing software updates.</p>
