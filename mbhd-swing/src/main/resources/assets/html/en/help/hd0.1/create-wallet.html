<h3>Create Wallet</h3>

<p>When you start DigiBit HD for the first time you will be shown the Welcome Wizard which will guide you through the
  process of creating a new wallet. If you want to create an additional wallet you can use the "Restore" button from
  the "Enter password" screen which will bring up the Welcome Wizard starting at the "Select Create Wallet Option" screen.</p>

<p>This help article will guide you through the Welcome Wizard from the beginning.</p>

<h4>Accept the licence</h4>

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/en/screenshots/mbhd-0.1/accept-licence.png" title="Accept licence screen shot"/>

<p>The DigiBit HD licence is very permissive and is based on the MIT licence. If you do not accept the licence then 
  you must Exit the application.</p>

<h4>Select a language</h4>

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/en/screenshots/mbhd-0.1/select-language.png" title="Select language screen shot"/>

<p>DigiBit HD benefits from a large number of translators who have generously given of their time and expertise to make
  your experience of using the application as natural as possible. If you would like to contribute to this translation effort
  please visit <a href="https://translate.multibit.org/project/multibit-hd" target="_blank">our translation site</a>.
</p>

<p>After selecting your language the screen will immediately refresh to use it.</p>

<h4>Select "Create Wallet" option</h4>

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/en/screenshots/mbhd-0.1/select-create-wallet.png" title="Select 'Create Wallet' screen shot"/>

<p>At this point you can choose to switch to a pre-existing wallet or restore one from a seed phrase. In this article
we are creating a wallet for the first time so the appropriate option is "Create Wallet" as shown.</p>

<h4>Make preparations</h4>

<p>Creating a Bitcoin wallet is a serious business and we strongly recommend that you give yourself some time to familiarise
  yourself with the steps involved before proceeding.</p>
  
<p>In short, the process is:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select a backup location</li>
    <li>Write down a seed phrase and a timestamp</li>
    <li>Confirm that you have written down the information correctly</li>
    <li>Provide a password for day to day use</li>
  </ol>

<p>Each step is necessary in order to ensure that you can benefit from as much security for your digibytes as possible and is
explained in more detail for each screen.</p>

<h4>Select backup location</h4>

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/en/screenshots/mbhd-0.1/select-backup-location.png" title="Select backup location screen shot"/>

<p>Security is hard, but making a backup of your work is the easiest way to ensure that you can recover from a serious
problem that may occur in the future. By signing up with a reputable backup service like <a href="https://spideroak.com" target="_blank">SpiderOak</a> 
or <a href="https://dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> you can be sure that your data is continuously pushed to the cloud. Then, if your computer is lost, stolen or damaged you can replace it, reinstall DigiBit HD and recover your digibyte simply by accessing your online backups.</p>

<p>DigiBit HD always saves your data encrypted and this can only be recovered using your seed phrase which offers a
very high level of protection.</p>

<p>If you don't have a backup solution in place you can skip this step and add it in later. We strongly recommend that you use one to avoid potential data loss in the future.</p>

<h4>Create seed phrase</h4>

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/en/screenshots/mbhd-0.1/create-seed-phrase.png" title="Create seed phrase screen shot"/>

<p>Your <strong>seed phrase</strong> is a collection of 12, 18 or 24 words that protect all of your digibytes. If someone else gains possession of your seed phrase they can spend all of your digibytes so keep it secret, keep it safe. You don't need to access your seed phrase for day to day use of DigiBit HD but you will need it in emergencies where your computer is lost, stolen or damaged.</p>

<p>You can use the refresh button to choose a different seed phrase and you can choose to have more words as necessary. The more words you have the less likely it is that someone can guess your seed phrase. The default of 12 words is considered secure enough for a lifetime's use with Bitcoin, 24 words is the equivalent of a Bitcoin private key itself.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you write your seed phrase down using pen and paper, seal it in an envelope and put it into a fireproof box alongside your other valuable papers.</p>

<p>If you want to make a copy, perhaps for safe keeping with a legal firm, then only use a pen and paper. Any kind of digital copying (digital camera, mobile phone, scanner, photocopier etc) will leave a record of the seed phrase in its internal memory and thus the seed phrase might be compromised. By only using a pen and paper and a sealed envelope you are ensuring maximum safety.</p>
  
<h4>Confirm seed phrase</h4>

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/en/screenshots/mbhd-0.1/confirm-seed-phrase.png" title="Confirm seed phrase screen shot"/>

<p>In order to be sure that you have written down your seed phrase correctly you must enter it here. Be sure to include the timestamp as well.</p>

<p>When you have correctly typed in all the words in your seed phrase a "verified" message will appear and you will be able to proceed to the next step. If you don't see this message, make sure you verify that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>all words are in lower case</li>
  <li>all words are spelled correctly in United States English (e.g. "color" not "colour")</li>
  <li>you have entered the timestamp correctly</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are stuck use the "Previous" button to go back. This will cause a fresh seed phrase to be generated so that you can try again.</p>

<h4>Create password</h4>

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/en/screenshots/mbhd-0.1/create-password.png" title="Create password screen shot"/>

<p>The password is for day to day protection of your wallet. Each time you start DigiBit HD, or perform a privileged operation (spending, signing etc) you will need this password. It can be recovered using your seed phrase and a wallet backup file if you forget it.</p>

<p>We recommend that you use a password management tool such as <a href="https://lastpass.com" target="_blank">LastPass</a> or <a href="http://keepass.info/" target="_blanl">KeePass</a> to generate and maintain strong passwords automatically.</p>

<p>In order to be sure that you have entered the password correctly you need to enter it twice at which point a "verified" message will be shown.</p>

<h4>Review report</h4>

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/en/screenshots/mbhd-0.1/create-wallet-report.png" title="Create wallet report screen shot"/>

<p>As your wallet is created you can view its progress here. Each stage is accompanied with a checkmark or cross to indicate success or failure. </p>

<h4>Enter password</h4>

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/en/screenshots/mbhd-0.1/enter-password.png" title="Enter password screen shot"/>

<p>This is the first screen that you will see each time you start DigiBit HD. Simply enter your password and click the "Unlock" button (or press ENTER) to begin using your wallet. You can use the "Restore" button if you forget your password or need to create/restore a wallet.</p>
