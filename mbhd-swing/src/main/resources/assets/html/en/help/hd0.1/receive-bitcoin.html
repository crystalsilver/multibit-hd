<h3>Request payment</h3>

<p>To request digibyte from someone else they need a "receiving address". Multibit-HD gives you a new receiving address each time you select "Send/Request" and then "Request".</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the "Request payment" screen you don't <em>have</em> to fill anything in.  You can just copy the the address, by:
    <ul>
      <li>highlighting the address and using CTRL-C, or</li>
      <li>selecting the copy icon, or</li>
      <li>selecting the QR code icon, to get a QR code that a Bitcoin wallet on a mobile phone could use to send you digibyte.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>However, you <em>can</em> add more information about the digibyte you want to receive. For instance, you could
    <ul>
      <li>enter a private note (e.g. "Payment for software development") to help you keep track of why you're receiving digibyte,</li>
      <li>specify the amount you expect (either in digibyte or in the local currency),</li>
      <li>add a label for the QR code. The QR code contains the address, the label and the amount all in a convenient format.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  <li>Click "Finish" to go back to the Send/Request screen.</li>
</ol>
