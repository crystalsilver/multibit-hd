<h3>How to install</h3>

<p>After downloading the installer from the website you will see the installation application. This article will guide you through the process of installing DigiBit HD on Windows,
  Mac and Linux using this application.</p>

<h4>Launch the installer</h4>

<p>Double click the installer to begin the process.</p>

<p>At this point you can choose to overwrite a previous installation, if present, or choose a new installation location. Your wallet and configuration files will be shared
  between each installation of DigiBit HD so it is generally best to select the overwrite option.</p>

<p>The DigiBit HD installer contains its own Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is set apart from any other that may be present on your system. After you click Finish you
  can launch DigiBit HD in the usual manner for your operating system - usually a double click of its shortcut. At this point the JRE will configure itself which may take up
  to 30 seconds to complete. Subsequent launches will not incur this one-off time delay.</p>

<h3>Operating system specific help</h3>

<p>While the vast majority of installations proceed without a hitch, there are occasions when certain configurations cause problems. Fortunately, the DigiBit user community
  has given us feedback about these problems and the workarounds they found to work. We present a list below in the hope that you will find them useful to you.</p>

<h3>OS X</h3>
<p>The DigiBit HD installer is slightly different from a standard OS X installer in that it doesn't rely on a single drag and drop into the Applications directory. However,
  once the installer has completed the resulting package in Applications can be dragged to the launch bar as usual.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<h4>How to get a launch icon into the dock (Ubuntu 12.04+)</h4>
<p>The following script will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>build a suitable <code>digibit-hd.desktop</code> file and register it with Unity</li>
  <li>configure the USB HID rules to allow a Trezor device to work</li>
  <li>create a symlink to DigiBit as <code>/usr/bin/digibit-hd</code></li>
</ul>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
echo Move into position...
mkdir /opt/digibit-hd
cp mbhd-$1-linux /opt/digibit-hd/digibit-hd
cp logo.png /usr/share/icons/hicolor/128x128/apps/digibit-hd.png
chmod +x /opt/digibit-hd/digibit-hd

echo Create symlink...
ln -s /opt/digibit-hd/digibit-hd /usr/bin/digibit-hd

echo Activate HID USB...
cat << _EOF_ > /etc/udev/rules.d/99-digibit-hd.rules
# Trezor HID device
ATTRS{idProduct}=="0001", ATTRS{idVendor}=="534c", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
_EOF_

echo Build Unity desktop...
cat << _EOF_ > digibit-hd.desktop

echo Done. Please check the Unity dock.
</pre>

<p>To run it, launch <code>gedit</code> and copy-paste the above and save as <code>install-ubuntu.sh</code>. Use <code>chmod +x install-ubuntu.sh</code> to allow it to
  execute then launch with <code>sudo ./install-ubuntu.sh</code>. When complete you will have a launch icon in the dock that you can locate using "DigiBit" in the search.</p>

<h4>How to run DigiBit HD manually</h4>
<p>You can run DigiBit HD manually as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open a terminal window and <code>cd</code> to your installation directory (e.g. <code>/opt/digibit-hd</code>)</li>
  <li>Launch with <code>digibit-hd.sh</code></li>
</ol>

<h4>How to install Java on Linux</h4>
<p>DigiBit recommends Java 7. To install Java on a recent copy of <strong>Ubuntu</strong> open a terminal window and type:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk</pre>
<p>You will be prompted for your system password and then it will install the required packages.</p>
<p>If you are running an older version of Ubuntu (e.g. something like Ubuntu 10.4 LTS) you will have to use the following:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install openjdk-<b>6</b>-jdk</pre>

<p>For <b>RedHat / CentOS</b> the installation command is:</p>
<pre>yum install java</pre>

<h4>OpenJDK doesn't work for me...</h4>
<p>Some people have had issues using MultiBit with OpenJDK on Arch Linux and OpenSuse distributions. The error manifests when trying to add a password to a wallet and occurs deep
  within the platform-specific parts of the JVM. If this affects you the error will be like this:</p>
<pre>
SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007f97ec7d06a0, pid=588, tid=140289289742080
</pre>

<p>After some research <a href="https://github.com/jim618/multibit/issues/325" target="_blank">members of the DigiBit community</a> found that installing the Oracle Java 7 JVM
  fixed the problem. To install Oracle's JDK do the following:</p>
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
</pre>
